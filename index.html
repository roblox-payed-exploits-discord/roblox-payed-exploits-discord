			<label for="spoiler1">Elysian</label>
			<div class="spoiler">
				<div class="spoiler_wrap">
					<div class="spoiler_body" style="display: block;">
						Pros:
						<br />
						I can say, without a single shred of doubt, that Elysian is the no. 1 exploit for me.
						<br />
						The UI is kinda plain, but gets the job done.
						<br />
						Plus, whitelist auth process takes less than 3 seconds, updates semi-quickly,
						<br />
						and it has a decompiler. The best part of Elysian, though, is its <span style="font-weight: bold;">stability</span>.
						<br />
						It has <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">never&nbsp;</span>crashed on me before, even when running massive scripts or complex ones.
						<br />
						Elysian also has its own unique features like mouse1press (presses the left mouse button), elysianexecute, mousescroll,
						<br />
						mousemoverel(moves the mouse) and much more.
						<br />
						<br />
						Cons:
						<br />
						The whitelist is account-based.
						<br />
						You can only change the whitelisted account once every hour.
						<br />
						Decompiler is still kinda buggy, though this will probably be fixed.
						<br />
						Hard as f*** to get since it rarely comes on sale, but when it does, there are a limited amount of copies, and they sell out really quickly.
						<br />
						And because it's so damn hard to get, I'm not going to recommend it if you're impatient. If you're patient, go ahead and wait for it.

						Price: $45

			<label for="spoiler2">ProtoSmasher</label>
			<div class="spoiler">
				<div class="spoiler_wrap">
					<div class="spoiler_body" style="display: block;">
						Pros:
						<br />
						<br />
						Well, since I own ProtoSmasher, I'd just like to say it's one of the best exploits I've ever used.
						<br />
						Slappy updates faster than you can say 'oh hey roblox updated'
						<br />
						and did I mention it comes with a TrustCheck bypass?
						<br />
						Loadstrings, GetObjects is also supported.
						<br />
						It's stable, the ui looks great, and it has a decompiler. If you want a level 7 I recommend you get ProtoSmasher.
						<br />
						<br />
						Cons:
						<br />
						There are times where ProtoSmasher would fail to authenticate. (Not often, but it happens).
						<br />
						It doesn't survive games that uses universes, the ones that teleport you to another place like Apoc, Arcane adventures, etc.
						<br />
						<br />
						Price: $50
